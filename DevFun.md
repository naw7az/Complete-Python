Developer Fundamentals 1 - Don't read the Dictionary
that means do not try to learn everything because u can't ,no one can.
if needed something just go to python website and read it.

Developer Fundamental 2 - Commenting your Code
a.) Try to comment your code so that other programmer can understand it.
b.) Write your code in such a way that anyone can read it like proper english without a need to comment.
c.) Only apply option 'a' when there is something complex about your code and don't try to comment everything.

Developer Fundamental 3 - Understanding Data Structures
a.) Should know what data structures to use when.
b.) The reason we have to use key in dictionary is that a dictionary is unordered and each value cannot be printed by a number which is the case in list.
   (eg: print(lists[0]---this is the position where 1st item is stored) , can't do this with dictionary.
c.) And this is a silver lining for dictionary where we can tell the user what the value means by the use of a key.

Developer Fundamental 4 - What is good code?
a.) To have a clean code that python community understand.
b.) The code should be readable.Make sure it's not only U that understand your code.
c.) To have a predictable(easy to understand) code. To use tools which everyone can understand.
d.) DRY-Do not Repeat Yourself.

Developer Fundamental 5 - Test your assumptions
a.) Test and write(the code for) whatever comes to your mind to check if it works
b.) If the output is different from your expectation, then learn why is that.

Developer Fundamentals 6 - Pros and cons of libraries
a.) Only use those packages which are actually good and used by most people in the community.
    Some of the packages can be buggy.At the end of the day, packages are created by developers
    which can have bugs in them, so check online before using.
b.) Before importing a package ask yourself "could I write it myself ?", because we only need
    few functions from each package and we can save a lot of memory. If it is real time consuming to
    write it yourself then import the package.
c.) But at the same time, these libraries are the reason what makes our work easier and we need them.

Developer Fundamentals 7 - Pick the RIGHT library
a.) We should use library that are up to date which works properly with the latest version of python.
b.) Always check for the community support a library has before installing it.
    ex: Stars, Forks(basically means copied the code, since it's an open source)
